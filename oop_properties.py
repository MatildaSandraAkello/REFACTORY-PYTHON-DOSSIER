# PROPERTIES / PRINCIPLES OF OOP
"""
1. ABSTRACTION - Helps in naming and identifying Classes.
# Abstraction is the ability to ignore something and concentrate on something particular e.g concentrating on the name of the class only
# All objects have a level of abstract

2. ENCAPSULATION - is the ability to hide or control access to some of your internal data. e.g 
the 3 levels of access we have public, private, protected.

3. POLYMORPHISM - the ability for an object to take on more than one form e.g a dad can be a dad, man, family head, parent, ugandan
